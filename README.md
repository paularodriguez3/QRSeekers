# QR Code Reader Android App

This a simple Android app developed in Kotlin to introduce me to mobile app development. It´s a **QR Code Reader clone**
made using ***Google ML Kit*** and ***CameraX*** libraries.

The purpose was to made a simple app to know how mobile development goes, learning those mentioned libraries in the process. For 
that reason, the UI is very simple (does not use Material Design) and currently it´s designed for **portrait mode** (in landscape mode
the design is not optimized).

Also, it´s been developed for a personal use, without doing the necessary steps to publish the app in the Google Play Store. That´s why if 
you want to test the app, you would have to clone the repository and generate an APK file (Android Studio IDE has an option for this in Build menu), installing
the app after that in your device.

Hope you enjoy it!
